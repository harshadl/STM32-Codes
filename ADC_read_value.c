/* This program converts the analog input from channel 1. * Channel 1
is connected to input from PA1.
* Clock prescaler is left at 0 (divided by 2) and Sampling * time is
also left at default of 3 cycles.
* Software trigger is used. The bit 8 of the conversion * result is
used to turn on/off the LED0. For the full
* scale of the reference voltage, the LED0 should be on * for 8
times.
*
* This program was tested with Keil uVision v5.24a with DFP v2.11.0.
